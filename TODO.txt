Keep separation of concerns (use_cases, runner, controller)

id's should be used to select items.
don't use xpath. keep this in mind and maintance will be easy.

The code now uses time.sleep() == bad.
Should use a wait that polls the page until a certain id is visible.

Replace print by logs.

ERROR == selenium fails. eg click goes wrongs.
FAILS == step assertion fails. eg confirm_welcome_email throws AssertFail.
